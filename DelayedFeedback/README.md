To address the challenge of predicting delayed conversions for app ads, we can break down the approach into several key components:

1. Understanding Delayed Conversions
Delayed conversion prediction involves forecasting user actions (e.g., installs, purchases) that occur long after an ad impression. The main challenge is associating these outcomes with the original ad exposure due to the time lag involved.

2. Label Handling Strategies
Incremental Updates: As more data becomes available over time, models can be updated incrementally to include new conversion information.
Time Windows: Define specific windows during which conversions are considered relevant to the ad impression, allowing for real-time predictions while accounting for delayed outcomes.
3. Feature Selection
Ad Features: Include details about the ad's content, targeting criteria, and placement.
User Behavior: Track interactions before and after seeing the ad to understand how they influence future actions.
Temporal Features: Incorporate time-related features such as the time since last interaction or seasonal trends.
4. Model Solutions
Survival Analysis: This approach is useful for predicting the time until an event occurs, making it suitable for delayed conversions.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): These models can process sequential data over time, capturing temporal dependencies in user behavior.
5. Evaluation Metrics
Use metrics that account for the temporal aspect of predictions, such as Time-Dependent AUC or modelspecific metrics from survival analysis.
6. Industrial Practices
Ensemble Models: Combining different algorithms can improve prediction accuracy.
External Data Sources: Enrich features with additional data to better capture user behavior and preferences.
7. Computational Efficiency
Optimize model training by using efficient algorithms or distributed computing frameworks to handle large datasets with time-series components.
8. Literature Review and Case Studies
Review existing research papers and case studies to identify successful approaches and best practices in handling delayed conversions.
